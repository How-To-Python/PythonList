## 🔑 Key Features of Lists

1. **Lists are mutable** - You can change their contents after creation
2. **Zero-based indexing** - First element is at index 0
3. **Negative indexing** - Count from the end with -1, -2, etc.
4. **Slicing is powerful** - Use `[start:stop:step]` to extract sublists
5. **List comprehensions** - Elegant way to create lists with `[expr for item in iterable]`
6. **Many built-in methods** - append(), extend(), remove(), pop(), etc.

<!-- 

## Built-in Functions
- **['zip()'](./zip_func.py)**
    - used to combine multiple iterable objects into a single iterable of tuples
- **[`enumerate()`](./functions/enumerate_func.py)**
    - creates pairs of index and value from an iterable


## Custom Functions

### Robust data processing functions that intelligently handles both single and multiple category list structures
- [`simple_processor()`](./processListStructure/README.md)
    - uses `emumerate()` function
- [`compact_processor()](./processListStructure/compactProcessor.py)
    - uses `zip()` function
