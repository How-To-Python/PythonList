## Built-in Functions
- **['zip()'](./zip_func.py)**
    - used to combine multiple iterable objects into a single iterable of tuples
- **[`enumerate()`](./functions/enumerate_func.py)**
    - creates pairs of index and value from an iterable


## Custom Functions

### Robust data processing functions that intelligently handles both single and multiple category list structures
- [`simple_processor()`](./processListStructure/README.md)
    - uses `emumerate()` function
- [`compact_processor()](./processListStructure/compactProcessor.py)
    - uses `zip()` function
